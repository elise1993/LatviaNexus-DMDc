Supporting code and data for the paper Jonsson et. al. (2025) "Policy impact assessments within the Water-Energy-Food Nexus using Dynamic Mode Decomposition" (in publishing).

Data is based on the STELLA-based system dynamics model in Su≈°nik et. al. (2021) "System dynamics modelling to explore the impacts of policies on the water-energy-food-land-climate nexus in Latvia" https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969721008949

Attribution and projection studies can be performed using the templates `dmdc_example_ensemble_attr.py` and `dmdc_example_ensemble_proj.py`, respectively.

The file `environment.yml` can be used to create a reproducible environment using e.g., Conda: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html
